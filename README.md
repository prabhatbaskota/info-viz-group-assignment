Youth Substance Use Trends – Interactive Dashboard

This project is an interactive visualization dashboard developed for Group Assignment 2 of the Information Visualization course. It explores patterns of smoking and drug experimentation among youth using a coordinated, multi-view visual analytics system.

The dashboard is based on the Youth Smoking and Drug Experimentation Dataset (2020–2024) and allows users to analyze behavioral trends across age groups, genders, and time.

What the Dashboard Shows

The dashboard contains four coordinated visualizations:

Behavioral Heatmaps showing smoking and drug use intensity by age group and gender

Line Chart showing yearly smoking trends

Scatter Plot showing relationships between peer influence and substance use

Grouped Bar Chart comparing smoking and drug experimentation across age groups

Each chart provides a different analytical perspective on youth substance use.

Interactivity

Users can interact with the dashboard through:

A global gender filter that updates all charts at once

Hover tooltips that show exact values

Linked views, where changes in one control update all visualizations

This allows users to explore and compare patterns dynamically.

Technical Approach

The dashboard is implemented using D3.js with modular chart components.
A central controller loads and filters the data, while each chart updates in response to global changes, enabling coordinated multi-view analysis.

Goal

The goal of this project is to help users better understand how smoking and drug experimentation vary across youth populations and how these behaviors relate to age, gender, and peer influence.
